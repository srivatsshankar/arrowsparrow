# Arrow Sparrow

## Every student's mini-tutor

### Coursework is tough

Arrow Sparrow is an application designed for students at all levels of education. With many things on our minds – personal life, jobs, extracurricular activities, and more coursework – we just don't have the time to summarize and recap each class, even though we really want to. And it joins the procrastination pile.

Wouldn't it be great if you had someone to help.  Giving you more time to your day and a better outlook to your grades.

No questions.

No stress.

### Your personal course assistant

Arrow Sparrow helps students handle the demands of their coursework. Just upload your course recording, course notes, or other material and have it summarized in seconds. Key points are extracted to provide critical learning points so that you just have the most important content needed.
